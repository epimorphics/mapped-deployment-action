# Old scripts

This scripts and unused and may be out of date.

Composite actions are supposed to be able to reference script files in the action using `$/path/script` syntax but this doesn't work.
So the current implementation has moved the scripts to inline and later bug fixes may have only been applied to the inline copies.
